I put the sample data in the file "sample data.txt", it's a 10000X51 matrix. 
I composite it by stacking 10000 times draw by row.

The file "covariance matrix for erdata.txt" is the covariance matrix for 
"erdata.txt", it's a symmetric matrix with diagonal as 1.

The file "covariance matrix for sample data.txt" is the covariance matrix for
"sample data.txt", this is also symmtric, but the diagonal is just close to 1.

There exists some nuiance between the above two files, but they are almost the same,
therefore, it might just be some bias from samples.
