A short write up about the result we get.

The 5 biggest result is in the file "resultlist.txt", 
the most interesting one is the fifth value,
I run the program for many times, 
and I noticed that the fifth value will sometimes change from 42 to 21.

It might because I use the average of Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo estimation
to evaluate the order, and we know that Monte Carlo one will change
every time you rerun the program, so the fifth of the linklist changes.

Besides, I also use valgrind to check the memory leak, 
it reported some error and memory leak, but the error message is weird.
Therefore, I check it on the Internet, and some of the people have the same problem
said that this problem is cause by the MPI, So I just leave it.
(I also check the example from Lecture, it has the same problem.)
